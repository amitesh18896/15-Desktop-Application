Mozarella Ashbadger is the latest revolution in web 
browsing! Go back and forward! Print! Save files! Get help! 
(youâ€™ll need it). Any similarity to other browsers is entirely 
coincidental.

## Code notes

### Tabbing

Adding tab support complicates the internals of the browser a bit, since we
now need to keep track of the currently active browser view, both to update
UI elements (URL bar, HTTPs icon) to changing state in the currently active
window, and to ensure the UI events are dispatched to the correct web view.

This is achieved by using intermediate slots which filter events, and by
adding signal redirection (using lamba functions to keep it short).
