# Brown Note — A desktop Post-it note application in PyQt

Take temporary notes on your desktop, with this floating-note app. Notes
are stored locally in a SQLite database.

This app is very simple, but demonstrates creation of decoration-less windows in PyQt. Removing the window
decorations removes the means to drag windows around, so we must re-implement this behaviour ourselves.
