# 15-Desktop-Application


A desktop application is a software program that can be run on a standalone computer to perform a specific task by an end-user


A collection of 15 small — *minute* — desktop applications written in Python
using the PyQt framework. These apps are intended as examples from
which you can poke, hack and prod your way to writing your own tools.


## The apps

The apps showcase various parts of the Qt framework, including advanced widgets,
multimedia, graphics views and decorationless windows. However, the most
generally interesting/feature complete applications are Minesweeper, Solitaire
and Paint.

## Getting started


To use each app you first need to install the requirements. In most cases
the only requirements are PyQt5, and occasionally requests. To install
app-specific requirements change to the folder of the app and run:


pip3 install -r requirements.txt


Once the requirements are installed, you can run the app using Python 3.


python3 <filename>.py


The application window should appear.
